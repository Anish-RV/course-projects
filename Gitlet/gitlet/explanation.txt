We had some issues with our implementation that took longer than expected to fix.
For example, we tried to serialize too many classes, which cluttered up our code
and forced us to seek alternatives. We also did not realize that commits needed
to make a copy of the file as the 'snapshot' as we were just trying to use the 
generated SHA value of the contents of the file.
